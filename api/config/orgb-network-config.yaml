# The network connection profile provides client applications the information about the target
# blockchain network that are necessary for the applications to interact with it. These are all
# knowledge that must be acquired from out-of-band sources. This file provides such a source.

# Any properties with an "x-" prefix will be treated as application-specific, exactly like how naming
# in HTTP headers or swagger properties work. The SDK will simply ignore these fields and leave
# them for the applications to process. This is a mechanism for different components of an application
# to exchange information that are not part of the standard schema described below. In particular,
# the "x-type" property with the "hlfv1" value example below is used by Hyperledger Composer to
# determine the type of Fabric networks (v0.6 vs. v1.0) it needs to work with.

# section.
#
channels:
  # name of the channel
  channel:
    # Required. list of orderers designated by the application to use for transactions on this
    # channel. This list can be a result of access control ("org1" can only access "ordererA"), or
    # operational decisions to share loads from applications among the orderers.  The values must
    # be "names" of orgs defined under "organizations/peers"
    orderers:
      - orderer.example.com

    # Required. list of peers from participating orgs
    peers:

      peer1.orga.example.com:
        # [Optional]. will this peer be sent transaction proposals for endorsement? The peer must
        # have the chaincode installed. The app can also use this property to decide which peers
        # to send the chaincode install request. Default: true
        endorsingPeer: true

        # [Optional]. will this peer be sent query proposals? The peer must have the chaincode
        # installed. The app can also use this property to decide which peers to send the
        # chaincode install request. Default: true
        chaincodeQuery: true

        # [Optional]. will this peer be sent query proposals that do not require chaincodes, like
        # queryBlock(), queryTransaction(), etc. Default: true
        ledgerQuery: false

        # [Optional]. will this peer be the target of the SDK's listener registration? All peers can
        # produce events but the app typically only needs to connect to one to listen to events.
        # Default: true
        eventSource: false

    # [Optional]. what chaincodes are expected to exist on this channel? The application can use
    # this information to validate that the target peers are in the expected state by comparing
    # this list with the query results of getInstalledChaincodes() and getInstantiatedChaincodes()
    chaincodes:
      # the format follows the "cannonical name" of chaincodes by fabric code
